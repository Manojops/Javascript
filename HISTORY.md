okay first of all we know about history of javascript

Creation of JavaScript

1 . In 1995 Netscape Communications Corporation needed a way to make web pages more interactive and dynamic.
2 . Brendan Eich was hired by Netscape to develop a new scripting language for this purpose.
3 . The language was initially called Mocha and later changed to LiveScript.
4 . In December 1995, LiveScript was renamed JavaScript, partly to capitalize on the growing popularity of the programming language Java.
5 . JavaScript was designed to be lightweight, interpreted, and primarily used for client-side scripting to manipulate web page elements in real-time.
6 . The language was quickly integrated into Netscape Navigator, the leading browser of the time, marking the beginning of JavaScript’s role in web development.

Basically Javascript runs on browser like chrome,firefox.Each browser have a javascript run engine.In chrome v8 engine runs to run our javascript program and spidermonkey engine runs our javascript program on firefox browser.
Here Node is very useful for programmer,developer.Because it helps to run our program into our Machine.So this is the main things to learn from history of java
